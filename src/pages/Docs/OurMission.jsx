                    <hr/>
                    <p>The aim of the project is the following: a platform that allows writers the creation and self-publication
                        of
                        the books or web novels without allowing the publishers to take advantage of the authors. It means that
                        the
                        writers themselves decide when to publish, when to delete, when to sell and when to allow the free
                        access to
                        the books. The author is the one who decides what the price for their book should be and the copyrights
                        are
                        owned by the writer himself.</p><br/><br/>

                    <p>The e-library we are creating not only allows the publication of the books but also helps in promotion of
                        the books. Not only that, but the authors can actually promote their books and web novels themselves
                        with a
                        built in promotion system on the platform.</p><br/><br/>

                    <p>The following problem of piracy is also a problem that needs to be solved for writers. We are developing
                        with our IT-team a smart contract NFT system to encrypt the chapters so that only the actual buyer has
                        access to the chapters.</p><br/><br/>

                    <p>Adding up what was said before we are also developing a system for the worldofwriter.com platform to
                        include
                        the NFT smart contracts to actually allow the writer to sell the copyrights to their books in whatever
                        percentage they want. When the book is bought by someone, the money the writer receive will get
                        allocated to
                        the owner of the NFT copyrights in the corresponding amount.</p><br/><br/>

                    <p>Finally, when all our development aims are fulfilled, we plan to minimize the fee the writers pay to the
                        platform down to no more than 5%. To achieve the goals we need support both financial and IT. The
                        development of the project is going to take time and resources. However, we hope that we can give you at
                        the
                        end the platform that allows writing of books and novels with almost no fees, keeping your authors
                        writes,
                        protects your creation from pirates and allows you to sell your works. Then you can earn even more by
                        selling your copyrights for the book while allowing others to earn and benefit from your works too.</p>
